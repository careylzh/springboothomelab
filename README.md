# springboothomelab
I just want to use this platform to consolidate all the concepts I've come across in Spring

Of course, as a `wr1t3r 4t h34rt`, the first thing I do is to define commit hygience and other `S0Ps` at the top of my current mind:

### Commit Hygiene
[!conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) 
- gentle learning curve: easy to rmb and implement
- prolly see myself committing very often and very erratically, depending on full-time work committments: I am learning new things about Spring all the time
  - but the idea is not to `anyhowly whack` and commit mindlessly - commit mindfully, summaries, don't just throw links into this repo

### Concept dump

### Existential concerns
If the purpose of establishing this new habit is to get good at Spring boot (and conseqeuently transferrable engineering concepts between stacks), then why should would spending time working on things outside of production-environments help to revise and reinforce engineering concepts applied to actual prod situations? 
- well `GPT3.5` suggested the `70-20-10` principle in my context of wanting to get better at engineering: mr chatGPT dude suggested that I spend:
  - 70% on hands-on (which is my work time), 20%
  - 20% on bookwork
  - 10% on deliberate, formal learning.
 Adopting this principle, I spend 8-9 hours at work 5 days a week, should be okay spending less than 1 hour a day (likely an `upp3r b0und`) on consolidating and reflecting on stuff. (This repo is not rly hands-on cuz it's largely illustrative code examples and setup playbooks)

### TODO
- [ ] AWS Lambda function with Spring boot (how to build Spring boot code on cloud through Jenkins and auto deploy new code on lambda functions with new build)
- [ ] That article I saw about Spring features.> [!NOTE]  
> This should be a key focus.

### Premise building
1. I want to live a long and happy life.
2. In order to live and long and happy life. It is important to keep the mind healthy.
3. To keep the mind healthy, I continue to make learning an enjoyment.
4. To learn well, it is good to base your learning off your current exposures, such as stack/tools. So it makes sense to take a deeper dive into features in Spring boot you can exploit, and document them for anyone who is interested to explore Spring boot as their main source of backend API development toolset. Anyway, some concepts are transferrable between stacks. Some day, maybe reading and memorising syntax will no longer be the blocker - but the blocker for anyone will always be to learn software engineering concepts deeply and apply them excitedly (where circumstances deem  fit).
